# PayPal and Monzo payment gateway

Sounds more fancy than it is...

* Take a value from the URL.
* Ask if the payment should go to [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/shortis) or [Monzo](https://monzo.me/alanshortis).
* Go to chosen provider with the value intact.
* Monzo can only accept payments up to Â£100, so go to PayPal automatically if the value is over that limit.
